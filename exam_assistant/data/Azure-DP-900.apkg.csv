327,What happens if you underprovision (by specifying too few RU/s).?,"Cosmos DB will start throttling performance. Once throttling begins, requests will be asked to retry later when hopefully there are available resources to satisfy it. If an application makes too many attempts to retry a throttled request, the request could be aborted. The minimum throughput you can allocate to a database or container is 400 RU/s. You can increase and decrease the RU/s for a container at any time. Allocating more RU/s increases the cost. However, once you allocate throughput to a database or container, you'll be charged for the resources provisioned, whether you use them or not.",azure-dp-900,simple
